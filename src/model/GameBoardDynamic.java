/**
 * <p>This class is a dynamic implementation of GameBoard.
 * Its size will increase when living cells comes close to the edge. This is done
 * by searching the edges for living cells and increasing the width and height variables
 * accordingly. The static byte arrays is larger than what these variables shows, and when
 * the variables gets near the actual array size, new larger arrays will be allocated
 * and the data copied over.
 *
 * <p>The byte arrays store information about the state of a cell and how many living
 * neighbours it has. The neighbour count for a cell is updated when a nearby cell is
 * set alive. This count is read in the next simulation step and cleared when
 * makeNextGenerationCurrent() is called.
 *
 * <p>There are some specific reasons for why we chose this solution instead of using
 * a dynamic List implementation from the Java Collection library:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The available lists don't support primitive types, and since we want our application
 * to be able to load the largest common patterns, storing the cell data
 * efficiently is key. The numeric data wrapper for a byte may occupy up to 16 bytes,
 * depending on the platform, and compared to only using one single byte, wrapping the
 * data in an object like this, is not something we want.
 * <li>Smaller memory usage per cell enables more of the board to fit in the processors cache,
 * which in turn causes fewer cache misses and faster simulation.
 * <li>The different List implementations all perform internal bounding checks on data access.
 * By making sure our simulator-implementations only do work inside of the allocated arrays,
 * we can skip these bounding checks for every cell read/write and further increase performance.
 * <li>We gain more control over the dynamic resizing by doing it this way. Reallocation is never
 * done mid-simulation and is only performed when strictly needed. Checks for when the board
 * should expand is not done on every read/write to a cell, but rather on a small selection of
 * cells near the edges, one time per simulation step.
 * </ul><p>
 * The Java Collection library offers allot of useful and convenient functionality, but for this specific
 * purpose we think our manual array implementation fits better. See the {@link GameBoardDynamicList}
 * class for a board implementation where Lists are used. We also wrote tests to support our claims, see the
 * GameBoardPerformanceTest class in the unitTests source folder.
