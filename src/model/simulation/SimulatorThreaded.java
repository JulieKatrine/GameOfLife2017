/**
 * <p>This implementation uses multithreading to carry out a simulation on a given GameBoard.
 * It uses the GameBoards methods to access and update each cell according to a specific rule.
 * The implementation creates a fixed pool of threads to be used for simulating different regions of
 * a GameBoard simultaneously. The amount of threads to be used is determined by the boards size
 * and the amount of available cores.
 *
 * <p>Every thread is given a horizontal region of the GameBoard to process. The amount of rows for each
 * thread is determined by the calculated thread count. Since the underlying data structure is stored
 * horizontally in memory, we heavily reduce the amount of cache misses by making each thread work on a set
 * of rows, instead of a set of columns.
 *
 * <p>The simulateNextGenerationOn() method uses a CountDownLatches to make sure all threads are done processing before
 * the generation is finalized with GameBoards makeNextGenerationCurrent(). Another latch is used to make
 * sure no threads are accessing the same data at the same time. Synchronization problems will only occur if a
 * slow running thread is accessing data at its to first rows, and a faster thread updates its last rows in
 * the adjacent region. This is solved by blocking all further processing until all threads are past their
 * second row and not allowing any threads to have fewer rows than 4. Boards with a smaller height than 8
 * will only utilize one thread.
